This repository contains the Latex files required to compile
a set of upper-division undergraduate lecture notes on 
Classical Electromagnetism. These notes 
were authored by Prof. Richard Fitzpatrick (Department 
of Physics, University of Texas at Austin).

The files will only compile properly when the following
standard Latex packages are installed:

fullpage
epsf
charter
euler
fancyhdr

The document can be compiled by issuing the command

latex 352

in the base directory (containing 352.tex).

The document will need to be compiled at least three times to
update all of the internal references, and to generate the
table of contents data.
